NeoPixel Raspberry Pi Pico LED Lights Python

Welcome! If you are looking to use a Raspberry Pi Pico and connect it to an LED strip (WS2812B single addressable) you are in the right place. 

I bought a Raspberry Pi Pico and wanted to create some cool light shows on an LED strip. Since the Pico is new (as of writing) I was having trouble finding documentation and proper setup for the Raspberry Pi Pico. I figured I could document my process and help you get started without hitting the same stumbling blocks I hit. 

I am attaching my lights inside a wizard hat, so I am buying battery packs to run my LED strip and Pico off AA batteries. I would buy the pico, battery holders, and everything else you can find off vilros.com its a little cheaper than buying from Amazon.

What you will need:
1. WS2812B single addressable LED strip - This is the one I ordered https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FK5QBJ?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
2. Raspberry PI Pico - pre soldered (or not if you have a soldering kit) https://vilros.com/collections/raspberry-pi-pico
3. 3 AA Battery Holder With Micro USB Connector to Pico https://vilros.com/products/3-aa-battery-holder-with-micro-usb-connector-great-for-raspberry-pi-pico
4. Wires set. I bought this set  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EV70C78?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
5. Low Voltage Wire Connectors to easily connect LED wires to pico wires. I bought this set off amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085PQG3L5?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
6. 4xAA Battery Pack Holder Case Box for LEDs https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T65WWCR?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
