NeoPixel Raspberry Pi Pico LED Lights Python

Welcome! If you are looking to use a Raspberry Pi Pico and connect it to an LED strip (WS2812B single addressable) you are in the right place. 

I bought a Raspberry Pi Pico and wanted to create some cool light shows on an LED strip. Since the Pico is new (as of writing) I was having trouble finding documentation and proper setup for the Raspberry Pi Pico. I figured I could document my process and help you get started without hitting the same stumbling blocks I hit. 

I am attaching my lights to a wizard hat, so I am buying battery packs to run my lights off AA batteries.

What you will need:
1. WS2812B single addressable LED strip - This is the one I ordered https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FK5QBJ?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
2. Raspberry PI Pico - pre soldered (or not if you have a soldering kit)
3. Wires set. I bought this set  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EV70C78?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
4. Low Voltage Wire Connectors to easily connect LED wires to pico wires. I bought this set off amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085PQG3L5?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
5. 4xAA Battery Pack Holder Case Box https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T65WWCR?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
6. DC Barrel Jack 10 Pairs 12V Male+Female... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J1WZENK?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
